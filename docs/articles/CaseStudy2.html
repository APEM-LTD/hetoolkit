<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This case study illustrates a typical HE Toolkit workflow using a
dataset first analysed by Dunbar et al. 2010 as part of the Environment
Agency-funded DRIED-UP2 study. The study used family-level
macroinvertebrate LIFE scores and a mix of gauged and modelled mean
daily flow data to explore how flow history and channel morphology
interact to influence macroinvertebrate communities in upland
rivers.</p>
<p>This re-analysis using the HE Toolkit has several differences from
Dunbar et al. 2010 as it focuses on a reduced set of 68
macroinvertebrate sampling locations in England, uses LIFE O:E ratios
rather than LIFE as the response variable, and uses updated
macroinvertebrate and flow data up to 2015.</p>
<p>As this case study is intended to illustrate the application of the
HE toolkit, rather than be a comprehensive analysis in its own right,
some of the analytical steps have been simplified for brevity.</p>
<p>This case study is optimised for viewing in Chrome.</p>

<p>We start by importing a “metadata” file with the following
columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>biol_site_id</strong> - a list of BIOSYS site IDs for the 68
macroinvertebrate sampling locations;</li>
<li>
<strong>rhs_survey_id</strong> - IDs of paired River Habitat Surveys
(RHS) (note: these are survey IDs, not site IDs);</li>
<li>
<strong>flow_site_id</strong> - IDs of paired sites for which gauged
or modelled flows are available (note that some flow sites are paired
with more than one macroinvertebrate site, so there are only 56 unique
flow site IDs); and</li>
<li>
<strong>flow_input</strong> - a vector specifying where to source
the flow data for each site (gauged flows from the National River Flow
Archive “NRFA” or Hydrology Data Explorer “HDE”, or modelled flows from
a local “RDS” file).</li>

River Habitat Survey (RHS) data from Open Data.</p>
<p>The function either:</p>
<ul>
<li>downloads RHS data from Open Data, <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/portalstg/sharing/rest/content/items/b82d3ef3750d49f6917fff02b9341d68/data" class="external-link uri">https://environment.data.gov.uk/portalstg/sharing/rest/content/items/b82d3ef3750d49f6917fff02b9341d68/data</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>or</strong> imports it from a local xlsx or rds file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data can be optionally filtered by survey ID.</p>
<p>Downloaded raw data files (in .zip format) will be automatically
removed from the working directory following the completed execution of
the function.</p>
<p>Below, we use our list <code>cs2_rhssurveys</code> to filter the
downloaded data.</p>
<p>To enable the RHS data to be joined to the biology and flow data at a
later stage, it is necessary to rename the <code>Survey ID</code> column
to <code>rhs_survey_id</code>.</p>

<p>To make a map of the biology sites, we use the environmental base
data downloaded from the EDE using <code>import_env</code>, this gives
us the biol_site NGR’s. The NGR’s are translated to full latitude /
longitude and matched back to the env_data.</p>
<p>Finally we use <code>mapview</code> to plot the points indicating the
sample sites. The points are labelled with the biology sample site ID,
the EA area code and the catcchment.</p>

<p>Prior to building a hydro-ecological model, it is important identify
any sites that could potentially be outliers because they are physically
dissimilar to the others sites in the dataset.</p>
<p>The <code>plot_sitepca</code> function performs a Principal
Components Analysis (PCA) which reduces a set of site-level
environmental variables down to two uncorrelated ‘principal components’
and plots these components as a two-dimensional scatter plot. Sites that
are closer together have more similar environmental characteristics. The
proportion of the total environmental variation explained by each
component is indicated on the axis labels. The first principal component
(PC1) is plotted on the horizontal axis, as it represents the most
dominant source of variation in the dataset. The environmental gradients
represented by the two axes can be interpreted by reference to the
arrows (eigenvectors), which show the direction and strength of
correlation between the principal components and the individual
environmental variables.</p>

<p>The <code>import_inv</code> function imports macroinvertebrate
sampling data from the Environment Agency’s Ecology and Fish Data
Explorer. The data can either be downloaded from <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/ecology-fish/downloads/INV_OPEN_DATA.zip" class="external-link uri">https://environment.data.gov.uk/ecology-fish/downloads/INV_OPEN_DATA.zip</a>
or read in from a local .csv or .rds file. The data can be optionally
filtered by site ID and sample date.</p>
<p>Below, we use our list <code>cs2_biolsites</code> to filter the data
from the EDE. We download data for the period from 1995 (pre-1995 data
was excluded due to uncertain QA procedures in place at this time) to
2021.</p>

<p>The <code>predict_indices</code> function mirrors the functionality
of the RICT2 model, by using the environmental data downloaded from the
EDE to generate expected scores under minimally impacted reference
conditions.</p>
<p>To run the <code>predict_indices</code> function, the ALTITUDE,
SLOPE, BOULDERS_COBBLES, PEBBLES_GRAVEL, SAND and SILT_CLAY fields must

<p>The <code>impute_flow</code> function is designed to infill missing
records in daily flow time series for one or more sites (gauging
stations) using either an interpolation or an equipercentile method.
Imputation of missing flow data can improve the later estimation of flow
statistics using the <code>calc_flowstats</code> function and aid
visualisation of hydro-ecological relationships using the
<code>plot_hev</code> function.</p>
<p>Here we use the equipercentile method and automatically select donor
sites to infill gaps in mean daily flow data. The donor site to be used
for each target site can be specified by the user via the
<code>donors</code> argument (see ?impute_flow for more detail).</p>

</h3>
<p>Dunbar et al. (2010) explored the how flows in the preceding six
month period influence spring and autumn LIFE O:E ratios. Flow
statistics were calculated for Winter (October-March) and Summer
(April-September) periods, and these two sets of statistics were each
z-score standardised to indicate whether winter flows were above or
below normal for that time of year, and whether summer flows were above
or below normal for that time of year. To mirror that analysis, we run
the <code>calc_flowstats</code> function twice - first for winter and
then for summer - so that the winter and summer flow statistics are
standardised separately.</p>
<p><code>calc_flowstats</code> takes a time series of measured or
modelled flows and uses a user-defined moving window to calculate a
suite of long-term and time-varying flow statistics for one or more
sites (stations).</p>
<p>The function uses the win_start, win_width and win_step arguments to
define a moving window, which divides the flow time series into a
sequence of time periods. These time periods may be contiguous,
non-contiguous or overlapping.</p>
<p>The sequence of time periods continues up to and including the
present date, even when this extends beyond the period covered by the
input flow dataset, as this facilitates the subsequent joining of flow
statistics and ecology data by the <code>join_he</code> function.</p>
<p>It is primarily designed to work with mean daily flows (e.g. as
produced by import_flow), but can also be applied to time series data on
a longer (e.g. monthly) time step. Regardless, the data should be
regularly spaced and the same time step should be used for all
sites.</p>
<p>The function also requires site, date and flow data columns to be
specified in order to run. The default values for these arguments,
“flow_site_id”, “date” and “flow” respectively, match the column headers
from the outputs of the <code>import_flow</code> and
<code>impute_flow</code> functions. The defaults allow the data from
these functions to be passed without editing into
<code>calc_flowstats</code>, however the names can be changed as normal
to match the data supplied.</p>
<p>This is an updated version of the <code>calc_flowstats</code>
function. The first iteration of the function, which employs fixed
6-monthly spring and autumn flow periods, remains available using
<code>calc_flowstats_old</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>calc_flowstats</code> returns a list of two data
frames. The first contains a suite of time-varying flow statistics for
every time period at every site, and is extracted using [[1]]. See
<code><a href="../reference/calc_flowstats.html">?calc_flowstats</a></code> for definitions of these statistics. The
second data frame contains long-term flow statistics and can be
extracted using [[2]].</p>

<h2 id="join-hydrological-and-ecological-data">Join hydrological and ecological data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#join-hydrological-and-ecological-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>join_he</code> function links biology data with
time-varying flow statistics for one or more antecedent (lagged) time
periods (as calculated by the <code>calc_flowstats</code> function) to
create a combined data set for hydro-ecology modelling. The function
provide two alternative methods for linking biology samples to flow
statistics for antecedent time periods: * Method = “A” (default), lag 0
is defined for each biology sample as the most recently finished time
period; * Method = “B”, lag 0 is defined as the most recently started
flow time period.</p>
<p>To describe the antecedent flow conditions prior to each biology
sample, the time periods are labelled relative to the date of the
biology sample, with lag 0 representing either the most recently
finished (method = “A”) or most recently started (method = “B”) flow
time period. The time period immediately prior to the Lag 0 time period
is the Lag 1 period, and the period immediately prior to that is the Lag
2 period, and so on. The function allows the user to select which
antecedent (lagged) time periods the biology data is joined to, e.g. lag
= c(0,1,2). This method is demonstrated in the schematic below.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../OneDrive%20-%20Apem%20Limited/Documents/rProjects/hetoolkit/articles/jeHE.PNG" width="349"></p>
<p>The function also includes an option to specify the “join_type”:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“add_flows” (default) produces a data set of biological metrics
(response variables) and flow statistics (predictor variables) for
hydro-ecological modelling.</p></li>
<li><p>“add_biol” produces a time series of flow statistics with
associated biological metrics which can be used to assess the coverage
of historical flow conditions using the <code>plot_rngflows</code>
function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below we use the join_he function with method B to join the spring
biology data to the most recent winter flow statistics (sw), and the
autumn biology data to the most recent summer flow statistics (as). We
use both “add_flows” to create a calibration dataset for
hydro-ecological modelling (called HE1) and “add_biol” to create a
dataset for visualisation (called HE2).</p>

<p>A hydro-ecological model has a greater chance of revealing
relationships between biology metrics and flow variables if the biology
samples span a wide range of flow conditions. Good coverage of
historical flow conditions by the biology sample data also means that
the calibrated model is likely to be better at predicting biological
responses under high and low flow scenarios.</p>
<p>The <code>plot_rngflows</code> function generates a scatterplot for
two flow variables and overlays two convex hulls: one showing the full
range of flow conditions experienced historically, and a second convex
hull showing the range of flow conditions with associated biology
samples. This visualisation helps identify to what extent the available
biology data span the full range of full range of flow conditions
experienced historically.</p>
<p>In the following example, the Q95z and Q10z flow statistics have been
selected as measures of low and high flows within each 6 month
antecedent period. The first plot shows all of the data from all of the
sites, and the second plot is faceted to show the data separately for
each site individually. For the dataset as a whole, the biology samples
appear to provide excellent coverage of historical flow conditions.</p>

<p>Once the biology and flow data have been processed and assembled into
a single data frame, spatial and temporal variation in a biological
metric of interest can be modelled as a function of one or more flow
summary statistics to reveal potential hydro-ecological relationships.
For datasets comprising multiple sites, linear mixed-effects models
fitted using the <code>lmer</code> function from the <code>lme4</code>
package have the ability to describe a ‘global’ relationship that
applies across all sites, whilst also quantifying the degree of
variability in this relationship from site to site.</p>
<p>Following Dunbar et al. (2010), we model variation in LIFE (expressed
as an O:E ratio rather than as an observed score to better control for
natural variation in invertebrate community composition) as a function
of: high (<code>Q10z_lag0</code>) and low (<code>Q95z_lag0</code>) flows
in the previous six-month winter or summer period; <code>Season</code>
(spring or autumn); Habitat Quality Assessment (<code>HQA</code>) score,
representing instream habitat quality; Habitat Modification Score
(<code>HMSRBB</code>) representing the extent and severity of
morphological channel alteration; and time (Year, centered to 2005 = 0,
termed <code>Year_cen</code>) to account for underlying long-term
trends. Selected interaction terms were also included to explore if and
how the effect of flow history varies with season, HMSRBB and HQA (see
Dunbar et al. 2010 for details).</p>
<p>To reflect the hierarchical structure of the data (samples nested in
sites), the models include a random intercept to account for
site-to-site variation in mean LIFE O:E. Following Dunbar et al. (2010),
we alos include a random slope to account for site-specific time
trends.</p>
<p>To illustrate the challenge of selecting a preferred model, we fit
four competing models of varying complexity and use cross-validation to
compare their predictive performance.</p>

<p>To aid model selection, the <code>hetoolkit</code> package includes
two functions for performing cross-validation.</p>
<p><code>model_cv</code> performs repeated, stratified k-fold
cross-validation, which can be used to evaluate a model’s ability to
predict the response at sites in the calibration dataset. Alternatively,
<code>model_logocv</code> performs leave-one-group-out cross-validation,
which can be used to evaluate a model’s ability to predict the response
at sites, not in the calibration dataset. Both functions can be applied
to a linear mixed-effects model (class: lmerMod) or a hierarchical
generalized additive model (class: gam) model with a single random
grouping factor. See <code><a href="../reference/model_cv.html">?model_cv</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/model_logocv.html">?model_logocv</a></code> for details.</p>
<p><code>model_cv</code> and <code>model_logocv</code> measure the
performance of the model under different situations, and so will not
necessarily agree on which is the best model. If the priority is to be
able to predict the response at sites in the calibration dataset, then
use <code>model_cv</code>; if the priority is to be able to predict the
response at sites, not in the calibration dataset, then use
<code>model_logocv</code>.</p>
<p>Here we use <code>model_cv</code> to compare the four candidate
models fitted above. Predictive performance is measured using the Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE); lower values indicate better predictions.
<code>r</code> is set at 10 to give stable RMSE estimates and
<code>control</code> is used to help prevent model convergence
issues.</p>

<p>The preferred model with the lowest RMSE (model 1) included the fixed
predictors <code>Q10z_lag0</code>, <code>Q95z_lag0</code>,
<code>Season</code>, <code>HQA</code>, <code>Year_cen</code>, and
<code>HMSRBB</code>, plus two interaction terms, while the random
effects included intercept and Year_cen varying by site. The diagnostic
plots (see below) indicate that all of these effects were approximately
linear.</p>
<p>On average, LIFE O:E was lower in autumn than spring, increased with
habitat diversity (HQA score) and decreased with the extent of habitat
modification (HMSRBB score). There was also an underlying long-term
increasing trend across all sites (Year_cen) of ca 0.03. After
controlling for these influences, LIFE O:E was positively associated
with the Q95z flow in the preceding six month winter or summer period
and to a lesser extent with the Q10z flow. The effect of Q10z was
stronger in autumn than in spring (Q10z * season interaction), and the
effect of Q95z decreased with the HQA score (Q95z * HQA interaction),
indicating that macroinvertebrate communities at sites with more
diversity habitat were less sensitive to antecedent low flows.</p>
<p>The random effects estimates showed a relatively large variance in
the intercept among the 68 sites, indicating a high degree of
unexplained spatial variation, but only a small variance in the Year-cen
effect, indicating a similar long-term trend across all sites. The
random intercepts and slopes were only weakly (r = 0.16) correlated.</p>
<p>In spite of the use of a smaller dataset (68 vs 87 sites) and LIFE
O:E ratios in preference to LIFE scores, these results are broadly
consistent with those reported by Dunbar et al. (2010).</p>

<p>The <code>diag_lmer</code> function produces a variety of diagnostic
plots for a mixed-effects regression (lmer) model. Below we create model
diagnostic plots for Model 1 as it had the lowest RMSE score.</p>

<p>These include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fitted vs observed values. This plot shows the relationship between
the fitted (predicted) and observed (true) values of the response
variable. If the model fits the data well, the points should be
clustered around the diagonal 1:1 line, which represents a perfect fit
(fitted=observed). Here we can see the model provides a reasonably good
fit to the data, but with a slight tendency to under-predict high LIFE
O:E ratios and over-predict low LIFE O:E ratios (which is very common in
regression modelling).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="CaseStudy2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="1152"></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Normal probability plot. This is a graphical technique for verifying
the assumption of a Normally-distributed error structure. The model
residuals are plotted against a theoretical normal distribution in such
a way that the points should form an approximate straight line. Here we
can see that the residuals conform very closely to a Normal
distribution, only small deviations at the extremities.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="CaseStudy2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="1152"></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Residuals vs fitted. This plot checks the assumption of homogeneous
variances, which states that the error variance should be constant
regardless of what value the response takes. Here we can see that the
residuals have a similar amount of vertical scatter at all fitted values
of the response, so this assumption is verified.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="CaseStudy2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="1152"></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Histogram of residuals. This is an alternative to plot 2 for
verifying the assumption of normally-distributed errors. Here we can see
that the probability distribution of the model residuals (shown in pink)
is very similar to a perfect Normal distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="CaseStudy2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="1152"></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Residuals vs model fixed predictors. To verify the assumption of
linearity, the model’s residuals are plotted against each of the fixed
predictors in turn. if the relationship between the response and each
predictor is truly linear, then there should be no trend in the
residuals. Here we can see that the linear (red) line fitted to the
residuals is horizontal, indicating that the strength of the linear
effects has not been over-or under-estimated. And in most cases the
loess-smoothed (blue) line is also close to horizontal; there is a small
departure from linearity for Q95z_lag0, Q10z_lag0 and Year_cen, but for
Q95z_lag0 and Q10z_lag0 this is due to a very small number of unusually
low/high data points and in all cases the deviations are very small, so
in this example a linear model appears to provide a reasonable
representation of these relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="CaseStudy2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="1152"></p>
<p>Other useful diagnostic plots for <code>lmer</code> models
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caterpillar plots, which plot the random intercepts and slopes for
each site as deviations from the global intercept and slope. Sites
coloured blue are those where, all else being equal, the intercept or
slope is higher than average, and red sites have lower-than-average
intercepts and slopes. This confirms that there is reasonably large (+/-
0.1) variation in LIFE O:E ratios from site to site that cannot be
explained by the other, fixed effects in the model. The random variance
for Year_cen is much smaller, but this still translates into important
differences in time trends among sites (see below for a clearer
visualisation).</li>

<ul>
<li>Partial effects plots, for visualising the fixed effects that are
common to all sites; these show the modelled effect of each predictor in
turn when other continuous predictors are held constant at their mean
values and factors are fixed at their reference level (i.e. spring for
Season). This confirms the positive associations with low flows (Q95z)
and habitat quality (HQA) and the negative effect of bed and bank
re-sectioning (HMSRBB).</li>

<ul>
<li>Interaction plots, showing how the effect of one predictor depends
upon the value of another predictor. Here we can see that the effect of
high flows (Q10z_lag0) is marginally stronger in autumn than in spring,
and how sites with poorer habitat quality (low HQA scores) are more
sensitive to low flows (Q95z_lag0).</li>

<li>Finally, the mixed-effect estimates of the time trend at each site
can be extracted and plotted. For reference, the vertical dashed blue
line is the global slope (i.e. the average time trend of 0.001 per year
- see the output from <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html" class="external-link">summary()</a></code> above). This shows that,
after accounting for inter-annual variation in flow, the majority of
sites display a trend of increasing LIFE O:E ratios over time, but that
a minority of sites have a decreasing trend.</li>
