# hetoolkit

<!-- badges: start -->

## Overview 

The `hetoolkit` package comprises a collection of 23 functions, developed by APEM LTD on behalf of the Environment Agency, to assemble, process, visualise and model hydro-ecological data. The full set of functions are listed under the Reference tab above. Note that they include deprecated versions of three functions that are retained for back-compatibility. 

## WORKFLOW

The different functions link together as shown in the flow chart below:

![](./man/figures/FlowChart_v01.png)

## Installation

To install the latest release of `hetoolkit` use the following code:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("APEM-LTD/hetoolkit")
library(hetoolkit)
```

As an alternative, the 'devtools' package can be used:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("APEM-LTD/hetoolkit")
library(hetoolkit)
```

It is recommended that you install `hetoolkit` into a blank project and use the `renv` package to avoid clashes with previously installed versions of dependent packages.

After running the install_github commands, you may get a message stating that some packages have a more recent version available, followed by a menu. This appears if any of the dependent packages required for the toolkit have a more recent version available than you currently have installed. Packages may be updated, however this is not required for the hetoolkit package to run. 

To skip the updates, either enter 3 in the console or simply press return. Note that if you run one of the full code blocks above all at once (ie, highlight all four lines and run them together) then this is skipped and no updates are made to the packages.

You may also get warning messages regarding unused arguments on installing the packages. These relate to arguments in function definitions that have been removed from the main body of the function but not the definition. These will be removed but in the meantime will not affect the running of the toolkit. 

## Development

The `hetoolkit` package was developed by APEM LTD on behalf on the Environment Agency. For further information please contact [Thomas Aspin](mailto:Thomas.Aspin@environment-agency.gov.uk).
