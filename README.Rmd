## Overview 

The `hetoolkit` package comprises a collection of 20 functions for assembling, processing, visualising and modelling hydro-ecological data. These are:

* `import_nrfa` for importing flow data from the National River Flow Archive (NRFA);
* `import_hde` for importing flow data from the Environment Agency (EA) Hydrology Data Explorer (HDE);
* `import_flowfiles` for importing flow data from local files;
* `import_flow` for importing flow data from a mix of the above sources; 
* `import_inv` for importing macroinvertebrate sampling data from the EA Ecology and Fish Data Explorer;
* `import_env` for importing environmental base data from the EA Ecology and Fish Data Explorer;
* `import_rhs` for importing River Habitat Survey (RHS) data from the EA's Open Data portal;
* `predict_indices` for calculating expected scores for macroinvertebrate indices using the RICT model (FBA 2020);
* `calc_flowstats` and `calc_rfrstats` for calculating summary statistics describing historical flow conditions;
* `join_he` for joining the above datasets;
* `plot_heatmap` for visualising and summarising gaps in time series data;
* `plot_hev` and `shiny_hev` for producing time series plots of biology and flow data;
* `plot_sitepca` for summarising environmental characteristics of biological sampling sites;
* `plot_rngflows` for Visualising the range of flow conditions experienced historically at a site;
* `model_cv` and `model_logocv` for performing cross-validation on linear mixed-effects models and hierarchical generalized additive models;
* `diag_lmer` for generating a variety of diagnostic plots for a mixed-effects regression (lmer) model; and
* `plot_predictions` for visualising the time series predictions from a hydro-ecological model.

## Installation

To install the latest release of `hetoolkit` use the following code:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("APEM-LTD/hetoolkit")
library(hetoolkit)

```

## Development

The `hetoolkit` package was developed by APEM LTD on behalf on the Environment Agency. Version 1.0.0 was released in May 2021. For further information please contact Mike Dunbar at the Environment Agency.
