\title{Converts OS Grid Reference to BNG/WGS coordinates.}
\usage{
osg_parse(grid_refs, coord_system = c("BNG", "WGS84"))

osg_parse(grid_refs, coord_system = c("BNG", "WGS84"))
}
\arguments{
\item{grid_refs}{This is a string (or a character vector) that contains the
OS grid Reference.}

\item{coord_system}{By default, this is "BNG" which stands for British
National Grids. The other option is to set coord_system = "WGS84", which
returns latitude/longitude coordinates (more info can be found here
https://www.epsg-registry.org/).}
}
\value{
vector made of two elements: the easting and northing (by default) or
latitude and longitude coordinates.
